🕶️ Blind Auction - Python Project

This is a simple Python-based Blind Auction program where multiple users can enter their bids privately. At the end of the auction, the program determines and announces the highest bidder.

💡 Features
	•	Accepts bids from multiple users.
	•	Stores data securely in a dictionary ({name: bid}).
	•	Clears the screen (simulated with blank lines) between bids to maintain privacy.
	•	Automatically compares all bids and declares the winner with the highest amount.

🛠️ How It Works
	1.	Each user enters their name and bid.
	2.	The program asks if there are more bidders.
	3.	If yes, the screen clears and the next user can bid.
	4.	When all bids are collected, the program identifies and prints the highest bidder.

📌 Example
Enter your name: 
Alice
Enter your price: 
300
Are there any other bidders? Type yes or no.
yes

Enter your name:
Bob
Enter your price:
400
Are there any other bidders? Type yes or no.
no

The winner is Bob with a bid of $400
